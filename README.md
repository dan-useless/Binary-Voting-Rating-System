# Binary-Voting-Rating-System

MINI PROJECT USING QUEUES

Rating System using compare and select technique with the help of Queue Data Structures. The project helps in rating & voting systems as a 1v1 option is given to the user. Basically a user has to add all the items that they have to compare, and the system would then randomly ask the user to select 1 option among the 2.

For eg:- A person has 5fruits to rate. They have to enter those five fruits first. They will be randomly asked to choose one fruit they like among 2 options, the number of times the question would be asked would also be random to have a fair result. This system therefore provides much accurate results with the help of ELO RATING algorithm.

Queue Data Structure has been used in this following program because data queues are a fast method of inter-process communication. Data queues free up jobs from performing some work, which can lead to a better response time and an overall improvement in system performance. 

There are mainly four functions which are present in the program, INSQ, DELQ, Probability, Elo Rating. INSQ and DELQ are mainly for inserting and deleting the QUEUES.

Since, it was done as a semester project, the report has also been added in the file section.
